# What is Cloudini?
As your cloud capacity grows, you will be faced with a corresponding need to maintain and enforce policy across a larger array of resources. As your cloud usage gets larger and your organization's policy requirements increase, the scope of your policy enforcement processes needs to expand to ensure consistent policy adherence and fast violation detection. Larger deployments justify a larger enforcement scope and may need to take advantage of more sophisticated enforcement mechanisms involving deployment standards, company's compliance and the ability to ensure policy alignment.

## Cloudini is about a couple of things, grouped into two main ideas:
• Compliance

• Cost reduction & security improvement & organization

## Business goals
• Cloudini will save customer’s resources alignment and compliant.

• Cloudini will simplify customer’s operations.

• Cloudini will save customer’s money.

• Cloudini will save customer’s time and IT humanity resources.

The customer will be able to create a policy(s) from a given list of policies, each policy is designed and implemented by Cloudini’s team. Each policy holds a violation parameter, means, what needs to be done for this policy to be violated, For example –

• Create an instance in a forbidden region

• Create more then 50$ per day EC2 instances

• Etc.

The customer can decide what action will be taken in case a violation appeared. (Email/SMS/Remove Instance etc..)
